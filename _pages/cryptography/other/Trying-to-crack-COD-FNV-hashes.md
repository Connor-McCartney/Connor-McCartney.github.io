# Using Wolfram Language

I had some troubles installing on arch, but seems easier on debian-based distros. 

You need to install the [Wolfram Engine](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/) and [WolframScript](https://www.wolfram.com/wolframscript/)

```
sudo dpkg -i WolframScript_14.0.0_LINUX64_amd64.deb
sudo ./WolframEngine_14.0.0_LINUX.sh
wolframscript
```
