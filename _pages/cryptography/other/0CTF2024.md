The first time LLL has betrayed me...

It seems the stronger BKZ is needed. 

A small discusison:

```
ConnorM (me):
is there any heuristic to choose BKZ block size? or just trial and error

grhkm:
Vibes

tl2cents:
maybe the root  hermite factor δ. The shortest LLL/BKZ-reduced vector satisfies ||b1|| < δ^n det(L)^(1/n). LLL has a practical roote hermite factor of 1.021 and for BKZ-20, it is 1.013.

grhkm:
this should be a sage feature :P

tl2cents:
according to this paper, it seems like an algorithmic thing. https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2008/49650031/49650031.pdf
