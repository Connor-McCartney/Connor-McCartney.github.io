# Overview

This is one of my favourite challenges I have ever solved and I'll do my best to explain everything :)

The description says "We have a bunch of certificates and a flag that is encrypted for one of these certificates. All RSA parameters underlying these certificates were generated by the same source."

We then have a folder of 1000 certificates which contains 1000 RSA moduli. 

Each modulus is of the form (for unknown g, M and random k's, a's):

$$n = (k_1 \cdot M + (g^{a_1} \text{ (mod } M \text{)})) \cdot (k_2 \cdot M + (g^{a_2} \text{ (mod } M \text{)}))$$

# Reading the certs

`git clone https://github.com/zerosumsecurity/squeamishossifrage && mv ./squeamishossifrage/LUDICOLO ./LUDICOLO`

There's 2 non-unicode filenames, we'll just rename them:

`cd ./LUDICOLO/certificates && mv 'NO'$'\353''LLE.crt' 'NOELLE.crt' && mv 'DANI'$'\353''LLE.crt' 'DANIELLE.crt' && cd ..`

Then we can read them:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from os import listdir

for cert in listdir("certificates"):
    key = RSA.import_key(open(f"certificates/{cert}", "rb").read())
    print(f"{cert}\n{key.n = }\n{key.e = }\n\n")
```

You can observe that e = `21558488234539889837938770635971330903489839146766895224490179041465516193145582266963154883831707522081140734421052039099233464837201660281606980530249` 

for every cert, but e won't be used to factor any of the moduli.

# Dealing with unknown m
