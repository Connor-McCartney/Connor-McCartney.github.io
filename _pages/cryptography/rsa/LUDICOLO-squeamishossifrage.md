# Overview

This is one of my favourite challenges I have ever solved and I'll do my best to explain everything :)

The description says "We have a bunch of certificates and a flag that is encrypted for one of these certificates. All RSA parameters underlying these certificates were generated by the same source."

We then have a folder of 1000 certificates which contains 1000 RSA modulii. 

Each modulus is of the form:

$$n = (k_1 \cdot M + (g^{a_1} \text{ (mod } M \text{)})) \cdot (k_2 \cdot M + (g^{a_2} \text{ (mod } M \text{)}))$$
