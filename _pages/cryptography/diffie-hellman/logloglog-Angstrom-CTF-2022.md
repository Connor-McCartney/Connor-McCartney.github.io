[Challenge files](https://github.com/Connor-McCartney/CTF_Files/tree/main/2022/angstromCTF/logloglog)

In this challenge $$p = 2^{1024}q + 1$$,  where q is a very large prime. <br>

We have $$a = g^e\ (mod\ p)$$

The standard Pohlig-Hellman algorithm uses all factors of p-1, but here e is small enough ($$e < 2^{1024}$$) that it can be recovered <br>
without combining the discrete log of every subgroup. (So we don't need to use the factor q, which would take too long as it's a large prime). 


```python
