@Mirai-Miki first posted the link about the new coin - <https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-01/act-spy-agency-releases-coin-with-secret-code/101391964>

@Chiefclapcheek figured out that the back of the coin had braille under some letters, which when put in order spelled 'atbash'.

This is a reference to the [atbash cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/atbash-cipher) which @h4sh and I found decodes the outer ring:
