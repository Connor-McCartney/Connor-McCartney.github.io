First, plug your phone into your computer. 

Then you have to go to USB preferences, and you want to choose 'This device' and 'File transfer/Android auto'

Note that depending on your type of USB-c cable, you simply won't be able to do this ...

But if successful, you can try see it in your file manager or use the tool `gmtp`
