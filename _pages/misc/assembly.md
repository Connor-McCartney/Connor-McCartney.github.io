There are many different assembly languages, depending on the CPU used. 

Intel and AMD commonly use the x86 architecture. 

32-bit CPUs commonly use x86 assembly. 

64-bit CPUs commonly use x86_64 assembly.

ARM assembly is another common one.

I'll just focus on x86_64. 

There are also many compilers, such as NASM and GAS. 

I'll use the GNU assembler (GAS, executable named 'as').

GCC actually automatically invokes GAS when compiling c code.
